  <p>I work for my county's leading CBC company, which most of you probably don't know what that is which is okay cause I don't feel like explaining myself anyways. On the side I have a Life Coach business, you can view here <a href="http://www.lifecoachsabina.com">Life Coach Sabina</a>.

<h3>Purpose</h3>

  <p>
    <mark>So what am I'm doing here?</mark> Well I'm figuring it along the way like most people. I hit a point in my career where I feel like most of my skills aren't being utilized. My need for challenges and problem solving aren't being met.
  </P>

<p>
  Covid-19 has given most of us extra time to <em>gain new skills</em> and <em>explore new hobbies</em>. I tumbled on a Youtube and eventually fell into the rabbit hole until I stumbled onto SWE/Coding videos.
